## 1. What this refactor is, in one paragraph

ClawTalk is being **rebuilt greenfield on the existing infrastructure**. The design — workspace tenancy, the canonical Workspace → Folder → Talk + Document model, jobs as first-class scheduled runs, Forge as autonomous content improvement, no Threads — is a clean-slate redesign. The runtime — Cloudflare Workers + Hono + Durable Objects + Hyperdrive + Cloudflare Queues + Supabase Postgres with RLS — is the existing infra. The shipped schema and code (`talk_runs`/`talk_threads`/`registered_agents`/`contents` and the per-user RLS model) is **disposable**: it served as the prototype that proved the requirements, and is being replaced by a single greenfield migration that drops 37 legacy tables and creates ~50 new ones from a clean spec.

This is not "evolve the schema." This is "the schema we have constrains every feature; rebuild it once, then build on top."

| 🅿️ Parked | The greenfield migration — written, locally validated, held at [`docs/canonical-greenfield-migration.sql`](./canonical-greenfield-migration.sql) | PR #502 closed; lands as `0040+` in `supabase/migrations/` when src/ rewrite ready |
| 🟢 Open PR | PDF rasterization Lane C T10 (render-pages affordance + capability surfacing) | PR [#506](https://github.com/jokim1/clawtalk/pull/506) |
| ⏭️ Next | `agent_role_templates` seed migration (Phase 1 Step 2) | TBD |
| ⏭️ Next | Cutover plan doc (one-page) | TBD |
| ⏭️ Next | src/ rewrite per §05 Phases 2–12 (executor, scheduler, queue consumer, accessors, routes) | Phased |
| ⏭️ Next | webapp/ rewrite per §05 Phases (every page touches new tables) | Phased |
| ⏭️ Next | §14 verification test suite (24 invariants) | Phased |
| ⏭️ Next | Phase 13 eval gate (harness contract done; scenarios + grader prompts TBD) | Phased |

**Why the migration is parked, not landed.** The migration SQL is structurally complete and locally validated against `supabase db reset`. But shipping it on `main` without the matching src/ rewrite breaks every accessor + route + test — 38/38 accessor tests + 21/30 google-drive tests fail because they target the dropped legacy tables (CI run on PR #502 confirmed this exactly as §14 predicted). Per Joseph's docs-only posture: the SQL lives at [`docs/canonical-greenfield-migration.sql`](./canonical-greenfield-migration.sql) as the canonical reference; the executable copy lands in `supabase/migrations/` only when the src/ rewrite catches up. See §14 (Cutover risk) for strategy options.

## 3. Why now

The shipped schema is the **proven prototype**, not the target. Specifically:

- **No tenancy.** The shipped DB is per-user (every workspace-shaped concept actually keyed by `owner_id`). Multi-workspace is foundational to the product model (D5) and was never built in.
- **Threads everywhere.** `talk_threads` couples every Talk-level concept to a thread that the new model has no use for. The pending-edit / context / runs surfaces all carry vestigial thread plumbing.
- **Vocabulary fork.** `contents` / `content_id` / `registered_agents` / `propose_content_append` are NanoClaw-era names that don't match the product spec's Document / Agent / `document_edits` vocabulary. Every PR re-translates.
- **Jobs were retrofitted.** The shipped `talk_jobs` writes its prompt as a `talk_message` and lands its output through a dedicated thread. The v8 spec (§12) restructures jobs as scheduled runs with snapshot-isolated prompt provenance and unified output via `document_edits`.
- **Forge was outside the schema.** §09 / §10 described a "content improvement loop" against tables that don't exist in the shipped model; nothing landable could be written until §11 absorbed the Forge schema.
- **RLS was per-user.** The membership predicate is a Workspace-level concept; the shipped model evaluates RLS as `auth.uid() = owner_id`, which works for single-user but breaks the moment a workspace has more than one member.

**The cheapest fix is to rebuild the schema once.** Per [DECISIONS](./DECISIONS.md) D0 + `CLAUDE.md`'s "treat data as disposable" rule, ClawTalk has exactly one live user (Joseph) and only dogfood data. No external users to migrate. No backwards-compat scaffolding to write.

## 4. What changes vs what stays

### Stays
- **Cloudflare platform.** Workers, Hono router, Durable Objects (UserEventHub), Hyperdrive (Postgres connection pool), Cloudflare Queues (TALK_RUN_QUEUE), Wrangler dev/deploy, R2 (attachments). [DECISIONS D1.](./DECISIONS.md)
- **Supabase Postgres.** Same project, same instance, same auth bridge (`auth.users` → `public.users` trigger).
- **LLM provider layer.** `llm_providers`, `llm_provider_models`, `llm_provider_secrets`, `workspace_provider_secrets` (these are LLM keys, NOT OAuth tokens), plus the live model discovery path (#484) that auto-inserts new Anthropic / NVIDIA models.
- **Event outbox / WebSocket Hibernation streaming.** `event_outbox` → `UserEventHub` DO. All streaming rides this.
- **Auth.** Google OAuth + email magic-link (planned) + device-code (CLI). HttpOnly cookies (`eb_at` / `eb_rt` / `eb_csrf`) + double-submit CSRF. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

### Changes
- **Schema.** 37 legacy tables dropped in one CASCADE; 50 new tables created from the spec. The greenfield migration is [`supabase/migrations/0038_clawtalk_greenfield.sql`](../supabase/migrations/0038_clawtalk_greenfield.sql).
- **Tenancy.** `workspaces` + `workspace_members` from day one; every workspace-owned table carries `workspace_id`; composite FKs prevent cross-workspace references.
- **Runs model.** New `runs` table with `snapshot_group_id` (per-run frozen roster), `agent_snapshot_id` (the acting agent), `trigger` (`user` / `scheduler` / `manual`), `scheduled_for` (slot identity for jobs), `prompt_snapshot_id` (immutable prompt at fire time).
- **Documents model.** First-class `documents` + `doc_tabs` + `doc_blocks` + `document_edits`. Replaces the `contents` / `content_edits` / `content_proposals` stack. Pending edits go through one unified accept path with CAS via `base_block_version` / `base_list_version`.
- **Jobs.** Scheduled single-agent runs per [`12-jobs.md`](./12-jobs.md). Single-txn claim with fire-time dep check; atomic queue-consumer claim; slot dedup + single-flight via partial uniques; output via two booleans (`emit_talk_message`, `emit_document_append`).
- **Forge.** First-class autonomous content improvement per [`09-`](./09-autonomous-content-improvement-prd.md) and [`10-`](./10-forge-design-handoff.md). `improvement_runs` + `document_versions` + held-out persona scoring + winner promotion via `document_edits.source='forge'`.
- **Home.** Inbox + recommendations + news as 14 `home_*` tables (§7), with structured ranking_profiles, algorithm versions + per-workspace assignments for percentage rollouts, news scoring formula reading topic.source_domains / topic.freshness_horizon_days.
- **Agents.** `agents` (workspace-scoped) + `agent_role_templates` (DB-managed role catalog with `version`) + `talk_agent_snapshots` (per-run frozen roster) + `run_prompt_snapshots` (per-run prompt provenance) + `agent_feedback_events`. Includes `is_system=true` agents for Forge rewriter/critic.
- **Tools + Connectors.** `talk_tools(workspace_id, talk_id, tool_id, enabled)` per-Talk toggles. `connectors` workspace-global + `connector_bindings` per-Talk binding. `connector_secrets` (encrypted OAuth tokens, separate from LLM provider keys).
- **RLS.** Workspace-membership predicate via `is_workspace_member` + `is_workspace_admin` security-definer helpers. Member-write canonical; 8 admin-write exceptions (workspace_members, connectors family, home algorithms/ranking). Service-role bypass via Postgres role with `bypassrls` privilege.

**Key runtime contracts:**
- **Snapshot freeze per run.** When a run is created, the executor (or scheduler) inserts a `talk_agent_snapshots` row per agent in the live `talk_agents` roster, sharing a fresh `snapshot_group_id`. The run carries that group id + the acting agent's snapshot id. Editing an agent or the roster mid-flight doesn't rewrite history — the snapshot is immutable.
- **Atomic queue consumer claim.** `TALK_RUN_QUEUE` is at-least-once and can deliver concurrently. The first consumer to flip `status='queued'` → `'running'` wins; others get an empty `RETURNING` and ack-and-drop.
- **Single-txn job claim.** The scheduler's Path A is one transaction: lock the due job (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), fire-time dep check, roster freeze, INSERT `runs` + `run_prompt_snapshots`, advance `next_due_at`, clear `claimed_at`, COMMIT. Queue dispatch happens outside the txn — if dispatch fails the stuck-queued sweep catches the orphan.
- **Slot identity.** `runs.scheduled_for` + partial unique `(job_id, scheduled_for)` makes "never fire the same job slot twice" a Postgres invariant.
- **Service-role bypass.** Scheduler / queue consumer / outbox writer / Forge executor / news ingest connect without `withUserContext`'s `set local role authenticated` swap, so RLS is bypassed by Postgres role privilege. User-input paths MUST call `withUserContext(authUserId)`.

## 7. Cross-cutting decisions (D0–D7, one sentence each)

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| **D0** | Greenfield rebuild, not migration. Drop the legacy schema; treat local data as disposable. |
| **D1** | Cloudflare Workers + Hono + DO + Hyperdrive + Queues + Supabase Postgres. No Redis. No BullMQ. No Next.js. |
| **D2** | Clean data model on Workspace → Folder → Talk + Document hierarchy. No Threads. Multi-workspace from day one. |
| **D3** | Forge rewriter / critic are built-in system agents (`is_system=true` rows in `agents`, hidden from `GET /agents` and roster). |
| **D4** | No Threads. Anywhere. The new model never had them; the old model's threads are dropped wholesale. |
| **D5** | Multi-workspace is foundational. `workspaces` + `workspace_members` from Phase 1 of the rebuild. |
| **D6** | Jobs designed clean per [`12-jobs.md`](./12-jobs.md): scheduled single-agent prompts firing normal runs; slot identity; archive not delete; service-role auth. |
| **D7** | Schema pressure-test resolutions: composite FKs for tenant integrity, `auth.uid()` RLS identity (no `app.*` GUC), `agent_role_templates` as a DB table, `llm_models` as a single catalog seeded from `llm_provider_models`, Forge SSR per-workspace, secret stores split (LLM keys vs connector OAuth). |

## 8. The schema in 30 seconds

- **Drop list:** 37 legacy tables (every `talk_*`, `registered_agents`, `contents` / `content_*`, NanoClaw user/oauth tables, web_search providers, `llm_attempts`). One `DROP TABLE … CASCADE` per §11 §11.1.
- **Kept list:** 12 tables (`users`, `event_outbox`, `idempotency_cache`, `settings_kv`, `provider_oauth_states`, plus the `llm_*` / `workspace_provider_*` stack). `users` gets `display_name → name` rename + drops the NanoClaw-era role / is_active / preferred_web_search_provider_id columns. `llm_provider_models` gets `capabilities_json` + a unique index on `model_id` so the new `llm_models` VIEW can FK against it.
- **New:** 50 tables across §1 identity → §10 audit. 4 deferrable back-edge FKs for true cycles (`messages ↔ runs`, `improvement_runs ↔ document_versions`). 7 trigger functions (universal `tg_touch_updated_at`, 4 business triggers, 2 RLS helpers). RLS enabled on every workspace-owned table.
- **Detail:** [11-data-model.md](./11-data-model.md) is the canonical schema source.

---

## 9. The behavior in 30 seconds

- **A user sends a message in a Talk.** `/chat` writes a `messages` row (`author_kind='user'`), inserts one `runs` row per agent in the live roster (sharing a fresh `snapshot_group_id`), inserts `talk_agent_snapshots` rows for the freeze, enqueues each run onto `TALK_RUN_QUEUE`. The queue consumer atomically flips `status='queued'` → `'running'`, the executor reads `run_prompt_snapshots` (or assembles fresh) + the snapshot's frozen fields + `talk_tools` / connectors authorization + the conversation context, calls the LLM, writes the agent message + advances run state, and emits outbox events that the per-user `UserEventHub` DO streams to the browser.
- **A scheduled Job fires.** The 1-minute cron tick reads `jobs WHERE status='active' AND next_due_at <= now()` `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Per claimed job: single-flight check, fire-time dep check (agent in roster + model enabled + primary doc if `emit_document_append` + tools enabled + connector authorized), roster freeze, INSERT `runs` (`trigger='scheduler'`) + `run_prompt_snapshots` (prompt frozen at fire time), advance `next_due_at`, clear `claimed_at`, COMMIT. Dispatch outside the txn. Any dep failure flips `status='blocked'` + writes a `home_inbox_items.type='job_blocked'` row in the same txn. On run completion, the queue consumer emits `job_output_ready` keyed by `ref_id = run.id` (at-least-once dedup via partial unique).
- **A user runs Forge.** "Improve this doc" projects an `improvement_runs.objective_json` from the workspace's default `forge_audiences` row (G-09.P0.1 RESOLVED — per [`09` §15 Q1](./09-autonomous-content-improvement-prd.md)). The improvement-run executor seeds ~20% of personas as held-out, runs the beam search over `document_versions` (per iteration: mutate, score against in-pool personas via SSR MCP, score against held-out, pick winners). On completion, the winning version lands as a `document_edits` row with `source='forge'`, reviewed through the same accept path the agent edits use.
- **Home surfaces it.** The inbox carries `forge_run_needs_review` items; recommendations include `forge-suggestion` candidates; news matches feed via `home_news_topics` (workspace-scoped, privacy-structural — only `summary` + keywords/entities/source_domains) against the shared `home_news_items` pool.

## 11. What's locked, what's open

### Locked
- §11 schema (validated end-to-end via `supabase db reset --local`).
- §12 jobs spec + scheduler/executor contract.
- §04 API endpoints + WebSocket event list.
- §06 agent system + roster-vs-snapshot model + system-agent flow.
- §07 home (inbox + recs + news enums + ranking surfaces).
- §09 + §10 Forge (vocab aligned, scope mapping spec'd).
- §01 + §08 product spec + IA (connectors workspace-global, jobs in-scope).
- §05 build plan phase sequence.
- DECISIONS D0–D7.
- SECURITY model.
- 10 deferred design-debt items resolved (forge_audiences `is_default`, fitness shape, score scale, co-editor level, SSR freshness, etc.).

### Open
- `agent_role_templates` seed migration (Phase 1 Step 2) — mechanical INSERT statements with prompts copied verbatim from [`03-agents.md`](./03-agents.md). Not yet written; will land as `0039_*.sql` or extend `0038`.
- Cutover sequencing plan — 0038 destructively drops 37 tables; the moment it merges, `src/` references break. Could use a 1-page coordination plan.
- Forge `forge_rewriter` + `forge_critic` system prompts — §06 §3.6 has placeholder "TODO: Joseph to write at impl time."
- Phase 13 eval scenario content + grader prompts — [eval-suite.md](./eval-suite.md) locks the harness contract but defers scenario content.
- Per-page visual design for new surfaces — [02-visual-system.md](./02-visual-system.md) covers tokens but doesn't have component-level designs for Jobs UI, Forge gallery / run-detail / Audiences, home Forge surfacing, DocTabStrip.
- ~37 P2 polish items per [SPEC-READINESS.md](./SPEC-READINESS.md). None block impl.

### Tracked design debt
[SPEC-READINESS.md](./SPEC-READINESS.md) has every closed gap with a stable ID (G-XX.PY.Z) and resolution note. Future drift catchable by re-running the verification audit pattern: see [`feedback_spec_corpus_parallel_close_verify_pattern`](../.claude/projects/-Users-josephkim-dev-clawtalk/memory/feedback_spec_corpus_parallel_close_verify_pattern.md) for the audit shape.

## 13. For the implementation reader

If you're about to write code, here's where to start by task type:

| Task | Start here |
|---|---|
| Writing the `agent_role_templates` seed migration | [03-agents.md](./03-agents.md) §2 (the 5 templates) + [11 §4](./11-data-model.md) (column shape) + the existing 0038 migration as the file format reference |

## 14. Cutover risk: the moment the migration lands

> **Status (2026-05-30):** Confirmed empirically. PR #502 attempted to land the migration as `0039_clawtalk_greenfield.sql`. CI ran and **38/38 accessor tests + 21/30 google-drive tests failed** because they target the dropped legacy tables — exactly as this section predicted. PR #502 was closed; the migration SQL is now parked at [`docs/canonical-greenfield-migration.sql`](./canonical-greenfield-migration.sql) until the src/ rewrite is ready. The cutover-strategy choice below is the gating decision.

The greenfield migration is **destructive**. The moment it lands on `main`:

1. **All 37 legacy tables are gone** (`talk_runs`, `talk_messages`, `talk_threads`, `talk_jobs`, `registered_agents`, `contents`, `content_edits`, `content_proposals`, NanoClaw user/oauth tables, etc.).
2. **Local data is wiped.** Per CLAUDE.md, this is by design — Joseph is the only user and the data is dogfood. Joseph re-OAuths Google / Anthropic / Forge SSR providers after the migration.
3. **Existing `src/` code that references the dropped tables CRASHES IMMEDIATELY.** Every accessor in `src/clawtalk/db/*` that targets `talk_runs` / `talk_messages` / `registered_agents` / `contents` / `content_edits` will throw on first call. Every route in `src/clawtalk/web/routes/*` that depends on those accessors will return 500s.
4. **The webapp breaks.** Every page that fetches from the broken routes will fall back to error states.

This is why [SPEC-READINESS.md](./SPEC-READINESS.md) flags **cutover sequencing plan** as the one remaining design-shaped item. Two paths:

- **Big-bang cutover.** One coordinated PR that lands the migration + every src/ + webapp/ rewrite + the seed in a single squash-merge. Maximum carnage, single transition window, simplest mental model. Joseph has zero downstream users; downtime is "ClawTalk doesn't work for an hour."
- **Feature-flag cutover.** Branch the code paths behind `CT_GREENFIELD` (or similar). Old paths read the legacy tables, new paths read the greenfield tables. Migrate per Phase. Higher complexity (dual-path code; runtime forks; double the test surface) for the benefit of "the prod webapp keeps working for the human while I'm migrating."

Both are valid. The right choice depends on whether Joseph wants to keep dogfooding the shipped app during the rewrite. **The migration stays parked at [`canonical-greenfield-migration.sql`](./canonical-greenfield-migration.sql) until this decision lands; it moves to `supabase/migrations/0040+_*.sql` only at cutover.**

## 15. Glossary of the most-confused terms

- **Talk** — a context-bound conversation in a workspace. Has a roster, rounds, messages, runs, and 0-or-1 primary Document.
- **Round** — a single turn of the multi-agent loop within a Talk. Messages and runs carry `round int`.
- **Run** — one agent's response within a round. Has a frozen roster snapshot (`snapshot_group_id`), an acting agent (`agent_snapshot_id`), a trigger (`user` / `scheduler` / `manual`), and either a triggering user message (`trigger_message_id`) or a prompt snapshot (`prompt_snapshot_id`).
- **Document** — the long-form editable artifact attached to a Talk (`primary_talk_id`). Composed of `doc_tabs` (≥1) → `doc_blocks` (paragraphs).
- **Tab** — a section within a Document. Co-editors are scoped per-tab (`doc_tab_coeditors`), not per-document.
- **Pending edit** — a `document_edits` row in `status='pending'`. Source can be `agent` (chat agent proposed), `forge` (winner promotion from an improvement run), or `job` (scheduled run output).
- **Job** — a saved scheduled run: prompt + agent + schedule. Fires through the normal run pipeline (`trigger='scheduler'`). NOT a parallel execution path.
- **Forge** — autonomous content-improvement loop. NOT the same as the agent prompt-improvement loop in §06 §14.
- **Snapshot group** — a set of `talk_agent_snapshots` rows sharing a `snapshot_group_id`. Captures the live roster at a point in time so future edits don't rewrite history.
- **Workspace member** — a user in `workspace_members` with a role (`owner` / `admin` / `member` / `guest`). RLS evaluates membership, not ownership.
- **Connector** — a workspace-level OAuth binding to an external service (Slack, GDrive, Gmail, Linear, GitHub, Notion). `connector_secrets` holds the encrypted token. NOT the same as a tool — tools authorize ON the binding.
- **Tool** — what an agent can DO (web search, gdrive_read, gmail_send, etc.). Per-Talk toggles (`talk_tools`). A tool may depend on a connector being authorized.
- **Inbox item** — a Home-surface notification (`home_inbox_items`). 12 canonical types including `job_output_ready`, `job_blocked`, `forge_run_needs_review`.
- **Audience** (Forge) — a saved persona set + reference set + question. The default audience is auto-selected when "Improve this doc" runs without an explicit objective.

## 16. Where this overview started → where it's going

The clawtalk repo dogfooded a multi-agent reasoning product through the NanoClaw / chassis / Phase 5 era. The shipped schema proved out the agent-room concept, the LLM-orchestration pipeline, the Workers + DO + Queues runtime, and the OAuth / cookie / CSRF auth model. Those proven pieces are what's kept.

But the schema couldn't bear weight beyond what it proved: per-user RLS, threads everywhere, the `contents` / `registered_agents` vocabulary, jobs-as-messages, no tenancy. Two design rebuilds (v7 → v8 jobs spec; the 11-data-model greenfield) and one spec-readiness close pass (~38 P0 + ~72 P1 gaps closed) brought the design to the point where the rebuild is writable from spec.

The migration is now written and validated locally. The next milestones are:

1. **Land PR #500** (design-debt resolutions) and **PR #502** (the migration).
2. **Write the `agent_role_templates` seed** (mechanical follow-up).
3. **Decide the cutover sequencing** (big-bang vs feature-flag).
4. **Begin §05 Phase 2** (workspace switcher + auth), then the rest of the phases in order.

When this is done, ClawTalk has a multi-tenant, jobs-aware, Forge-ready, Home-driven, eval-gated, RLS-enforced architecture that the shipped prototype could never have grown into incrementally. That's the bet of this refactor.
